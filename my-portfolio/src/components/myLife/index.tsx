                            I live in Fjellhamar with my soon-to-be wife and our daughter. I've been extremely lucky to have found a family that I love this much.
                            I'm a calm and caring person who values honesty, community, and positivity. I strive to be a positive force in the world around me,
                            and I believe in helping others wherever I can. I don't care much for drama â€” I have a 3-year-old, and that's enough drama for me!
                            I love to grow, to win, and to bring fairness and integrity into everything I do. My family is everything to me, and if I can make them happy,
                            then I'm happy.
                        </p>
